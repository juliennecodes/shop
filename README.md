Seaside Cafe is an app for a fictional cafe. In the app, the user can view the cafeâ€™s menu and order by adding menu items to the cart. They can also change their order by changing the item quantity or removing it altogether.

Seaside Cafe was primarily written to practice client-server communication. The frontend client makes GET, POST, and DELETE requests and the backend server responds with JSON.
