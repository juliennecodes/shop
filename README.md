# Seaside Cafe - practice app for client-server communication
Seaside Cafe is an app for a fictional cafe. In the app, the user can view the cafeâ€™s menu and order by adding menu items to the cart. They can also change their order by changing the item quantity or removing it altogether.

## Goals and Objectives
Seaside Cafe was primarily written to practice client-server communication. The frontend client makes GET, POST, and DELETE requests and the backend server responds with JSON.

## View Seaside Cafe App
demo - https://polar-plateau-65701.herokuapp.com/

## Setup
- go to project folder
- type command - npm install

## Running the App Locally
- type command - npm start

## Tests
- type command - npm test

## Deploy App in Heroku
### Preparations
- copy package.json of the react app and paste it on the same level as server.js
  - package.json app specifies the dependencies of the react app
- delete all the other scripts except for start
- change the start script to "start": "node server.js"
  - originally, npm start runs the react app
  - this change makes it so that the node express server is the one that is running on heroku
  - the node express server is the one serving the index.html of the react app
- write app.get("*", (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname + "/build/index.html"));
});
  - this makes it so that the server serves index.html for any get requests to any other endpoints that are not /menu or /cart
- write app.listen(process.env.PORT || 8000); in server.js
  - express server will listen for requests to the port in the environment variable

### Build Minified React App
- go to project folder
- type command - npm run build
- copy the build folder
- paste the build folder in the same level as server.js
  - the build folder is the minified react app, which will be what the server is serving for index.html 

### Deploy
- type command - heroku create
  - creates an empty heroku app - https://polar-plateau-65701.herokuapp.com/
  - creates an empty git repository - https://git.heroku.com/polar-plateau-65701.git
- type command - git subtree push --prefix src/server heroku main
  - this command is used because the code that will be pushed to heroku is in a subdirectory of src folder

## Redeploy Updated App
- make changes to the app
- go to project folder
- type command - npm run build
- copy the build folder
- paste the build folder in the same level as server.js
- go to https://localhost:8000/ to check if the server is serving up the minified react app
- commit changes to GitHub
- push changes to GitHub
- go to project folder
- type command - git subtree push --prefix src/server heroku main
